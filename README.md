# Flask application

Generate a Python application using the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
framework by clicking the next button:

This will ask you to authorize the [Atomist](https://www.atomist.com/)
application in your GitHub organisation/account then will ask you to provide
a set of parameters to generate the Flask application skeleton.

Once the project is generated in your GitHub organisation/account, simply
checkout the newly generated project and follow its README to get started.
